  development from Rosebank College, where I graduated in 2020. During my studies, I developed a deep interest in creating 
  efficient, user-centric applications and harnessing the power of technology to solve real-world problems. My education 
  equipped me with a solid understanding of programming languages, databases, and web development, laying the groundwork 
  for my journey into the tech industry.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I worked on various projects that honed my skills in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. 
  I have developed applications using languages such as Java, C#, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These experiences have enabled 
  me to cultivate an analytical mindset, paying close attention to detail while ensuring that the final product meets both user 
  needs and technical requirements.</p>

<p>As I transition from academia to the professional world, I am eager to apply my knowledge and continue learning in a dynamic 
  environment. I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and grow alongside talented teams, always striving to create 
  solutions that make a tangible impact. My goal is to combine my technical expertise with my enthusiasm for software
